				<p> Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot is often regarded as the Father of Thermodynamics. He was born in June 1, 1796. He would later become a French Scientist. He
				would enroll in  École Polytechnique in 1812 which provided him with fine education Mendoza (1998). </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> Additionally, he would develop a theory about heat engined. The theory predicted that effiency was dependent on the temperature of the engine. 
				He would also create the Carnot Cycle In the cycle the working substance of the engine undergoes four successive changes: expansion by heating at a 
				constant high temperature; reversible adiabatic expansion; compression by cooling at a constant low temperature; and reversible adiabatic compression.

				<p> Thermodynamics is science of the relationship between heat, work, temperature, and energy. In broad terms, thermodynamics deals with the transfer 
				of energy from one place to another and from one form to another Drake (2023). Heat wasn't recognized as a form of energy until Sir Benjamin Thompson 
				noticed that limitless amounts of heat could be generated in the boring of cannon barrels and that the amount of heat generated is proportional 
				to the work done in turning a blunt boring tool and Carnot's Carnot-cycle as well as the principle of reversability. </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> The laws of thermodynamics include the zeroeth, first, second and third law. The 0th law states that when two systems are in independent equilibrium
				with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other. The first law is the law of conservation of energy. Then we have the second law which states
				that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases and is always more than 0 or simply ΔS ≥ 0. The final law states that The entropy of a perfect 
				crystal of an element in its most stable form tends to zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero.</p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> A few notable equations in Thermodynamics include: <br> 1. ΔU = Q - W <br> 2. PV = nRT <br> 3. η = 1 - (Tc/Th) <br> 4. and (P2/P1) = ΔHvap/R (1/T1 - 1/T2) </p>
