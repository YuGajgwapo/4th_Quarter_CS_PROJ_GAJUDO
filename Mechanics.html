				<p> Sir Isaac Newton is often regarded as the "Father of Classical Mechanics". However, he is better known as "The Father of Physics" and rightfully so.
				Although Newton wasn't the kindest person, he invented the three laws of motion, and calculus. These two inventions are literally the basis for mechanics! </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> Additionally, he also outlined the principle of gravity. This single feat is known as the greatest contribution in the entirety of physics. </p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> Born in January 4, 1643, Isaac Newton would become an English Physicist who was the culminating of the 17th century scientific revolution.
				In 1665, Newton would be isolated in his own home due to a plague. It was then and there that he would create calculus as well as the 
				law of gravitation because he was apparently bored Westfall (2023). He would also be declared a knight by Queen Anne in 1705.</p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> So, What are mechanics? It is  science concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces, including the special case 
				in which a body remains at rest Goodstein (1999). It is also known as Newtonian Physics after its creator. Mechanics is divided into three
				branches. Static (which deals with forces acting on a body at rest), kinematics (tries to predict the motions of a body), and kinetics 
				(attempts to predict what motion is about to happen in a situation). As stated before, the basis for mechanics is the three laws of motion 
				and calculus.</p>
				<br> <br>
				<p> A few notable equations in Newtonian Physics include: <br> 1. F=ma <br> 2. F=(Gmm)/r² <br> 3. f=μN <br> 4. and F=pVg </p>
